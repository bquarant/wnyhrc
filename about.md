**What is the WNY Human Rights Clinic?**

The WNY Human Rights Clinic was founded in 2014 to serve the need for medical and psychiatric forensic evaluations of refugees seeking asylum status in the Buffalo area. We partner closely with the WNY Center for Survivors of Torture (WNYCST) through Jewish Family Service of Buffalo and Erie County to identify clients who may benefit from our assessments. The WNYCST aims to provide an intensive case management and strength-based client centered model to support survivors of torture in their healing process. The goal of the WNY Human Rights Clinic is to reinforce this endeavor by providing objective forensic examinations and creating affidavits based on our findings for use in legal asylum cases.

Our clinic is primarily medical student-run, and we are motivated by the knowledge that forensic examinations significantly increase the likelihood that asylum seekers will be successful in obtaining protection in the USA. We hope that the clinic will serve as a beneficial tool to educate volunteers about the struggles of our clients, the legal side of asylum-seeking, and the performance of forensic examinations.
