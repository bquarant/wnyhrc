**What is the WNY Human Rights Clinic?**

The WNY HRC was founded in 2014 to serve the need for medical and psychiatric forensic evaluations of refugees seeking asylum status in the Buffalo area. We partner closely with the WNY Center for Survivors of Torture (WNYCST) through Jewish Family Service of Buffalo and Erie County to identify clients who may benefit from our assessments. The WNYCST aims to provide an intensive case management and strength-based client centered model to support survivors of torture in their healing process. The goal of the HRC is to reinforce this endeavor by providing objective forensic examinations and creating affidavits based on our findings for use in legal asylum cases.

Our clinic is primarily student-run, and we are motivated by the knowledge that forensic examinations significantly increase the likelihood that asylum seekers will be successful in obtaining protection in the USA. We furthermore hope that the clinic will serve as a beneficial tool to educate volunteers about the struggles of our clients, the legal side of asylum-seeking, and the performance of forensic examinations.

**Partnership with Jewish Family Service**

The Western New York Center for Survivors of Torture (WNYCST) was established in June of 2014 to address the consequences of political and state-sponsored torture experienced by survivors living in Western New York.The WNYCST pairs each client with a care coordinator to obtain services from partnering agencies and resources from the community. These agencies include the University of Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Vive, Inc., Journey’s End Refugee Services, LakeShore Behavioral Health, and Catholic Family Center in Rochester. Since January of 2015, the WNYCST has served over 100 men and women from over 25 countries.

Clients receiving a forensic examination through the HRC may require their care coordinator to be present before, during, or after their examination. It is the care coordinator’s role to prepare and support their client through the difficult process of recounting his or her story. If at any time a client requires the need to speak to their care coordinator, please do not hesitate to contact the WNYCST at 1-​716-883-1914.​
