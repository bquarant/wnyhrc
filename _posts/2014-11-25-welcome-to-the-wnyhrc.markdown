Thanks for visiting the online home of the Western New York Human Rights Clinic!
 
We are a team of physicians and medical students from the University at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences working in partnership with the Jewish Family Services Center for Survivors of Torture and Physicians for Human Rights to provide medical and psychological forensic examinations to victims of political violence and survivors of torture.
