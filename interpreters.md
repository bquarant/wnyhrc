We are recruiting bilingual students and training them to serve as volunteer interpreters to facilitate communication between the asylum seeker and the clinician during forensic evaluations.

We are currently planning the first interpreter training session for Fall 2015. We expect this session will be a day-long seminar covering the role of the interpreter, important terminology for forensic evaluations, and other relevant material. 

Once you have completed the necessary training and have passed the proficiency exam you will be scheduled based on your availability.
