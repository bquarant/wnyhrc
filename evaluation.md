To request an evaluation...

What is a medical asylum evaluation?

Clinical evaluations occur for asylum seekers in order to establish the

facts surrounding abuse and torture. Having a physician or a medical expert produce a

written document or oral testimony provides a level of validity to an asylum seekerâ€™s case

that often cannot be attained in other ways. An asylum seeker is aiming to demonstrate

that they have a well founded fear of persecution due to their membership in a particular

social group, religion, political opinion, race, or nationality and are unable or unwilling

(due to this fear) obtain protection in that country.

Licensed clinicians provide the level of expertise needed for a valid evaluation. Specialists

(such as psychiatrists and gynecologists), primary care physicians, and licensed

psychologists can conduct these evaluations, depending on the needs of the client. In some

cases, asylum seekers may have multiple evaluations; a client may need a medical

examination to document scars and a psychological examination to document PTSD and

depression.

In an evaluation, the evaluator will ask a client for a thorough history of his or her torture

and other traumatic events, assess the client for possible abuse sequelae, document the

psychological and physical evidence of torture, and state the degree of consistency

between the narrative that the client has given and the evidence of torture that is found.

The clinician is to be an objective evaluator in the assessment of clients.
