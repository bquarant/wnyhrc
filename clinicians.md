The role of the clinician is to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the client's torture and to identify and document any consequential psychological of physical sequelae to support their asylum case. Clinicians have the ability to work with student scribes, who will take notes during the evaluation, assist with the physical exam, and prepare a draft of the narrative portion of the legal affidavit.

In order to participate, health professionals must attend an Asylum Training hosted by Physicians for Human Rights.
